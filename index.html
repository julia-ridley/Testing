		<h2>For this task you are going to be looking at images and determining how many recognizable people are in those images</h2>
		<h3>In the text box below the image, please type the number of people you see in that image</h3>
		<h3>You will be asked to input 4 numbers for each photo</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>"Full Head Count" is the number of complete (non-cut off) heads in the image</li>
			<li>"Partial Head- Top" is the number of heads that are partially cut off by the upper border of the image</li>
			<li>"Partial Head- Bottom", "Partial Head- Left", and "Partial Head- Right" are the same criteria for those respective edges of the image</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Here are a few guidelines</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>If a person's head is fully contained within the rectangle of the photo (even if the person is paritally 	obscured by other people or objects in the photo) include that person in your "Full Head Count"</li>
			<li>If a person's head is NOT fully contained in the picture (the head or face is is cut off at all by the border photo, include this person in your "Partial" count for the appropriate side</li>
			<li>If there are no people in the image, type "0" in the box</li>
			<li>If there are aspects of the image that make it difficult to count (e.g. image is distorted), type "unknown" in the box</li>
		</ul>
