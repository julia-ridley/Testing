		<h3>For this task you are going to be looking at images and determining the number of people in those images</h3>
		<h3>First, you should know who to include in your count: </h3>
			<h4>If at least half of the head, from <em>any</em> angle, is contained within the rectangle of the image, then include that person in your count. Do <em>not</em> include people <em>without</em> any part of their head showing </h4>
			<h4>For example, this man <em>would</em> be included in the count, because his head is more than half visible</h4>

		<h4>But this man would <em>not</em> be included in the count, because his head is more than half cut off</h4>

		<h4>Click on the person's head to count them. A red dot will appear and the counter below the image will increase. <br> To undo your count, click the "Undo" button next to the image</h4>
